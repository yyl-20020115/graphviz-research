    * criterion: version 2.2.0
    * Breaking: Renamed all unprefixed internal macros and functions that were
      exposed in the API, and moved them to criterion/internal.
      This shouldn't break your code if you did not use these in the first
      place.
    * Change: Added language-specific wrapping logic to decouple the language
      the tests are written in from the test runner.
    * Change: Rewrote the reporting logic to allow multiple test reports to be
      written using any format.
    * Addition: Added parallel jobs for the test runner.
    * Addition: Added C++ allocator for STL collections based on
      cr_malloc/cr_free.
    * Addition: Added criterion::parameters in C++ for simpler parameter list
      generation.
    * Addition: Added saner defaults when the tests detect they run under
      valgrind.
    * Addition: Added basic Objective-C language support.
    * Addition: Added JUnit XML reporting.
    * Addition: Added JSON reporting.
    * Addition: Added dynamic reporter registration.
    * Addition: Added back support for GCC 4.6 when compiling C tests.
    * Addition: Added single test execution mode.
    * Removal: Removed all deprecated 1.x unprefixed assertion macros.
    * Fix: Fixed some memory corruption happening on rare occasions on assert
      messages.
    * Fix: Fixed deadlocks happening at random when a large quantity of assert
      is present.
    * Fix: Fixed the library not compiling with the intel compiler collection.
    * Deprecation: All cr_assume_strings_* macros are deprecated in favor of
      cr_assume_str_*.
    * Deprecation: All cr_assume_arrays_* macros are deprecated in favor of
      cr_assume_arr_*.

    * criterion: version 2.1.1
    * Fix: Fixed bug where the TAP output access the assert message after

    * criterion: version 2.0.0

    * Change: Changed all assertion macros to accept a printf format string as a
      message.

    * Change: Made the library ISO C compliant. You can now compile the library
      with VC 14+.

    * Addition: Added C++11 throw assertions.
